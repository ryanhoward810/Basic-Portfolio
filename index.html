					<p> My name is Ryan Howard and I have been a successful sales and marketing executive for the previous 15 years. Due to a recent implosion in my sales verticle, I have decided it would be in my best interests to change careers than stay in a field I'm successful in, but have no passion for! </p>

					<p> I've been married for 15 years and have two beautiful daughters, Lyric age 12 and Luna age 5. They are my motivation for making this change as it will ultimately impact their future more than mine...
